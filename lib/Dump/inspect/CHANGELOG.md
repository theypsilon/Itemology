## v3.0.0

The basic functionality remains as before, but there's one backwards-incompatible change if you used `options.filter`.

* **Removed** `options.filter`
* **Added** `options.process`, which can be used to do the same as `options.filter`, and more.
* **Added** two new constants, `inspect.METATABLE` and `inspect.KEY`
* **Added** `options.indent` & `options.newline`.

* Added a new parameter, options.filter.
